# Tennis Quiz

## Overview
The Quiz App is a minimalist and intuitive web application designed to test users' knowledge on tennis history through an interactive quiz. The app keeps track of users' scores and at the end of each quiz, you can view your overall score and performance. Additionally, the app includes a leaderboard feature to display top scorers.

This project is built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database to store leaderboard data. The questions used for this app are obtained through an external [API](https://the-trivia-api.com/).
